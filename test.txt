Don't you dare look back, just put your eyes on me, I say you're holding back you said shut up and dance with me.
This girl is my destiny she said oh oh oh  shut up and dance with me

How does a moment last forever

I don't want to talk, about the things we've gone through, though it's hurting me, now it's history

Mamma mia, here we go again
