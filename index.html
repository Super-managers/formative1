<h2 class="p-2 alpha">About me</h2>
<p class="p-2">My name is Adams and I have worked on many project in the past few year, and I believe with a bit of pixie dust and imagination, we can turn our dreams come true</p>
<p class="p-2">These two are the most recent project I've done, I hope it will inspire you for your project.</p>
</div>
<div id="boardgame">
<h2 class="p-0 alpha">Board Game</h2>
<h3 class="p-2 bravo">What's this about?</h3>
<p class="p-2">Miteen X Economics --- I participate many events and competition every year. In 2020, me and my friends from economics department formed a group called SACRA and participated in “Play” It Forward HK@APEC Game Design Competition. Participating students will design and create a boardgame about pros and cons for trade and world-wide situation, using STEAM elements along economics knowledge and show ultimate creativity.</p>
<div class="p-2 text-primary-emphasis bg-info-subtle border border-info-subtle rounded-3 d-inline-flex">
  <h4>Learning can be boring but we chose an interesting way!</h3>
</div>
<h3 class="p-2 bravo">Objective</h3>
<p class="p-2">We heard the word 'trade' every day, but how can it affect us? Experience trading in this game, not only to learn its effect but to know what's happening in the world.</p>

<h3 class="p-2 bravo">How does it work?</h3>
<p class="p-2">Trade with your friends and get the product you need. Beware of special events, it can help but also hurts you.</p>

<h3 class="p-2 bravo">How to play</h3>

<p class="p-2">Pick an identity, roll the dice and move accordingly, execute what's on the board and that's all. You can trade whenever you want, set a price and ask the question 'Deal or no deal? </p>
<div class="p-2 text-primary-emphasis bg-warning-subtle border border-warning-subtle rounded-3 d-inline-flex">
  Please do not cheat nor rob nor steal on other players, it is just a game for everyone to learn and have fun.

  <h2 class="p-0 alpha">Fish Tank</h2>
<h3 class="p-2 bravo">What's this about?</h3>
<p class="p-2">Miteen X Good Mentor Scheme --- The participating students were responsible for designing and producing a smart fish tank with a computer-controlled environment and monitoring of approximately 6 feet x 1 foot x 1 foot. The entire production is composed of basic materials. Members can learn DIY and various techniques. The program content includes various STEAM elements.</p>
<div class="p-2 text-primary-emphasis bg-info-subtle border border-info-subtle rounded-3 d-inline-flex">
  <h4>COVID might be strong be it won't stop us!</h3>
</div>
<h3 class="p-2 bravo">Role</h3>
<p class="p-2">Everyone was tasked with a different role. My primary task was to design an autonomous feeding system. I was also tasked with assisting building basic infrastruture for the fish tank</p>

<h3 class="p-2 bravo">Design</h3>
<p class="p-2">Orginally there is two designs, both using stepper mottor to drive the device which is controlled by Arduino UNO.</p>

<h5 class="delta">Plan A</h5>
<p>Original Design was inspried by the gashapon machine. After experiments, it was found that the fish food was stuck in the system due to design issues. Therefore, the design of the waterwheel was changed to a vertical design, and after repeated experiments, it was changed to the current Ferris wheel design. This design can avoid the problem of food jams and increase flexibility.<br>
Revised design is similar to Ferris wheel with a total of 6 feeding containers. At specfic time, system will start the stepper motor to rate the Ferris Wheel 60 Degree, falling the food from the chamber to the tank.</p>
    
  <h5 class="delta">Plan B (aborted)</h5>
  <p>Design inspired by conveyor belt. Using a rack with stepper motor to push the baffle to feed the fish. At specfic time, the programe with drop an amout of fish food then activate the motor to drop the food.</p>
    
  <h5 class="delta">Plan X</h5>
  <p>Progress was significantly affected by Covid-19, after serveral twitst and turns,a feasible solution. 3D Printed turntable have 8 grid, stepper with turn 45 degree every other day to feed the fish automatically.</p>

  <h5 class="delta">Plan Y</h5>
  <p>Design go back to basic, inspried by gashapon machine. What is different with original is that exterior walls was change to interlock design, using combining design for the feeding chamber. The stepper motor will rotate 45 degree after a specfic period of time. Current setting is automatically feed every day. Working cycle is one week.</p>
  
  <h5 class="echo">Comparing this design with Plan X</h5>
  
  <p>Plan Y take approximately 3 hours to print where Plan X takes 5 hours, with the new design it uses less material, making it cheaper then before. With the previous deisgn will require users to remove screws to add Fish food where as this design is more user friendly. With a simple lift of the acrylic cover, user can add food without the need of screwing and unscrewing.<br>
  New design having higher fill density making it more durable then ever. In case of motor malfunction, new design can simply unplug the motor and replace with a new one. If the container was found broken or leaking, it can be print in 3 hour. If arcylic was found broken, it can be lasercut and ready to use in 15 minutes for both the top and the bottom.</p>
